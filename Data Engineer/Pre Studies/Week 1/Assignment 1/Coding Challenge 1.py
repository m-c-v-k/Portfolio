"""Python Challenges:
Coding Challenge 1 â€“ Extending the Health Potion Project
In this challenge we are going to expand on the project from the Udemy course section 4 about the 
health potion. We are going to remake this project with a couple of more operations, but without 
the difficulty system.


You should create an empty python script and call it week1_1.py. Create a variable called health 
with value 100. Then you should simulate getting attacked twice. Getting attacked means that you 
subtract a random number between 20 and 30 from health. Remember to do this twice! After the 
attacks you pick up a health potion, which here means that you add 10 plus a random number 
between 10 and 15 to the health. So if you roll 14 as the random number for the potion (it should 
be between 10 and 15 inclusive), you add 10+14=24 to the players health. In the end display 
(print) the remaining health."""
