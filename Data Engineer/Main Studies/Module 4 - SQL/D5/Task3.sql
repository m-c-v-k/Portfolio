-- At PostgreSQL Tutorial you try out more on LIMIT and OFFSET, still using DVDRental
-- database.

-- Task 3 â€“ CTE

-- 1. Use CTE to create a table that classifies customer_ids according to the total

-- amount having spent in payments. More than 120 are 'Big doggo's, less than 80 are

-- 'Smol pupper's and in between are regular 'Doggo's. Then select and list all the Big

-- Doggos.

-- 2. Create a new table 'deleted_payments', with one column, INT primary key

-- 'payment_id'.

-- 3. Use WITH to create a Data-Modifying Statement deleting payments made on

-- valentines day 2007 or before, and moving them into the table deleted_payments
