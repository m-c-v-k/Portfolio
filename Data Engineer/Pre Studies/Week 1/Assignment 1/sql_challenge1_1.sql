/*
SQL Challenge 1 - John goes to Brights

SQL is the programming language you use for communicating with a database and different 
implementations have slightly different dialects. As we have already mentioned the Udemy course 
uses PostgreSQL whereas the Learn SQL Online uses the SQLite dialect. You will need to adopt the 
SQLite code from the exercises to PostgreSQL dialect, but it’s only minor differences. In the 
Brights course itself we are going to use PostgreSQL, because of the more powerful feature set and 
its widespread use in the industry. But do not worry about that for now – just know that we use 
SQLite for the prestudies and that the SQL itself is very similar for the two dialects.

-- Nothing to hand in, just know the difference between SQLite and PoatgreeSQL dialects
